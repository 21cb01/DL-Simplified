# Portuguese Meals Classification

ðŸ”´ Project Title : Portuguese Meals Classification

ðŸ”´ Aim : Aim is to identify and recognize the meals images from the given dataset using a DL approach.

ðŸ”´ Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/catarinaantelo/portuguese-meals


**DESCRIPTION**

The dataset contains images of 23 different types of meals. There are 200 - 500 images of each type. The task is to classify the images by using a deep learning architecture.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

First I imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project. Then I imported the dataset and split it into training, validation and testing sets in the ratio 70:20:10. Then I proceeded to build the model. I have developed  deep learning model to classify the images.I used a CNN with MaxPooling layers and got a satisfactory accuracy score.
But as there is lack of data in the dataset the validation accuracy is quite low.

**MODELS USED**

The models are:

1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with MaxPooling layer

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

* kaggle
* tensorflow
* split-folders
* matplotlib
