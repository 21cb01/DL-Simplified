# Indian Food Image classification

Deep Learning Simplified Repository (Proposing new issue)
ðŸ”´ Project Title : Indian Food Images Recognition

ðŸ”´ Aim : Create a model which will recognize the images from the given dataset of food items.

ðŸ”´ Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/indian-food-images-dataset


**DESCRIPTION**

The dataset contains images of 80 different types of food. There are 49 images of each type. The task is to classify the images by using a deep learning architecture.

**WHAT I HAD DONE**

First I imported all the required libraries and dataset for this project. Then I imported the dataset and split it into training, validation and testing sets in the ratio 70:20:10. Then I proceeded to build the model. I have developed  deep learning model to classify the images.I used a CNN with MaxPooling layers and got a satisfactory accuracy score.
But as there is lack of data in the dataset the validation accuracy is quite low.

**MODELS USED**

1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with MaxPooling layer

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

* kaggle
* tensorflow
* split-folders
* matplotlib

**VISUALIZATION**


### Model 3 (CNN Model with MaxPooling layer) performance graphs

### Prediction

Prediction on a random image from the testing dataset.

## ACCURACIES

CNN Model with MaxPooling	99.36

## CONCLUSION

I was successfully able to develop a Deep Learning model that can classify images from the given indian food dataset which has 80 different variation
